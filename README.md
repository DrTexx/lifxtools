## Notable usages
- Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is well enhanced by the effect of average_screen_color.py; first few minutes of the film are of particularly strong effect.

## Todo
### Public Transport API Intergration
Intergration for multiple public transport APIs. This will involve making a package to translate multiple APIs to the general format (which is likely object-based)

Planned APIs to intergrate:
- PTV (Public Transport Victoria)
